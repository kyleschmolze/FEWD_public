## Bootstrap! 

It's more than a buzzword

It's CSS Framework! (aka. a CSS file that makes a bunch of nice classes for you, and styles a bunch of stuff by default)

It's also got an optional javascript library.

How to install? CDN!

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    
That was easy!

Get used to their documentation, let's head there: [getboostrap.com](getboostrap.com).


### Challenge: Create this page without any CSS!
