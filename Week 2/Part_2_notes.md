##Classes and IDs
Demo code: [starter_code/lesson 2/ids_and_classes](starter_code/lesson 2/ids_and_classes), and also in
[this codepen](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/JnfEd).

Read about IDs and Classes [here](http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/).

Open `index.html` and `css/style.css` (our custom CSS will be at the bottom of this file because it is a copy from the HTML template), read through the material, and then try implementing the `success` class!


##Exercise - CSS Selectors

Download and open the Word doc, `css selector challenges.docx`. For each page, try to come up with the CSS selector which selects the element(s) in red, *and no other elements on the page*.

## Floating Sections
Demo code: `starter_code/lesson 2/floats`, and also in
[this codepen](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/nHIEo).

Read through the sample code, try experimenting with the width percentages in `css/style.css`. Nathan also found a great explanation of floats [here](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101). 

You can (almost) use this exact overall layout in the lab / homework for today, Fashion blog part 2.


##Lab/Homework: Fashion Blog Part 2

Take the page you were working on for Fashion Blog Part 1, and now style it to look like `starter_code/lesson 2/fashion_blog_part2/Fashion Blog - Part 2 Final Product.png`.

Plan before you code! Try to figure out what boxes will contain which divs, and roadmap your html document before you start coding.
